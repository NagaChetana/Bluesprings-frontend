# BlueSprings

Minimal Vite + React scaffold to prototype the BlueSprings landing page UI.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (14+)

Install

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Tailwind is included in `tailwind.css` and `tailwind.config.js` but you must run `npm install` to fetch dev dependencies.
- If you want to use the exact design tokens, adjust colors in `tailwind.config.js` and expand components.
